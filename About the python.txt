|------------------------------About the Python------------------------------|


--Python is a general purpose, high level interpreted language with easy syntax and dynamic semantics 
--Created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989

Why python is popular ?
-easy
-free or open source
-application
-library and support 

features of python
-open source
-easy
-portable
-simplicity
-hug libraries
-interpreted
-object oriented
-portability
-embeddable & extensible 

python is a very interactive language

we can run python code on
1. vsCode 
2. Idle(use to run python code) of python to run code 
   IDLE is a simple tool that comes with Python for writing and running Python programs.


----Eg In Vs code 

print("Hello world!")
a=6
b=8
c=a+b
print("addition of 2 numbers:",c) 

----Eg in Idle 
1.
7+8
15

2.
if 0<15:    # :(colan is use to indicate the start of block 
    print("0 is less then 15")

    
0 is less then 15




Types of mode of Using IDLE to run python
1.interactive mode (use for small codes and on idle screen only)
2.Scripting mode (use for code for greater than 5 to 6 lines and it is open through    idle using new file) 

-------
python indentation

Most of the programming languages like c, c++, and java use braces {} to define a block of code, Python however, uses indentation.

A code block (body of a  function ,loop, etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block  . 

-------

Comment (#)

# is use to commant line of code in python
python does not support multiple line commant

-------

Python identifiers

an identifiers is a name given to entities like class, functions and variable. 
helps to differentiate one entity to another entity

Rules for identifiers
1. it starts with lowercase
2. It cannot start with number or special character except underscore(_)
3. do not use keywords as identifiers

--------

Python Keywords

keywords are the reserved word in python 

there are 33 keywords in python

------

How to find the type of variable 

a=10
print(type(a))
output = <class 'int'>

a='ganesh'
print(type(a))
output = c=<class 'str'>

c=True
print(type(c))
output = <class 'bool'>

------

Data types 

int 
string
float
char 
bool 


-------

Operators in python

1.Arithmatic Operator(+,*,-,/)
*
a=2
b=1
print(a+b)
print('gan'+'esh')
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b) #floor divison
*

2. Assignment operator 


3. comparison operator (return true or false) 
	it always checks the value stored in the variable 
	<,>,!=,==

4. Logical operator

	and, or, not 

5. Bitwise operator (It is use to shift the bit )
 
	|(or) , &(and) , ^(xor) , >>(right shift) , <<(left shift)

  eg: 
	e=2  #0010
	d=6  #0110
	print(e ^ d) #output = 4
	print(e & d) #output = 2 
	print(e | d) #output = 6
	print(d>>e) #output =1  d ko right shift kiya hai 2 se 
	print (d<<e) #output =24  d ko left shift kiya hai 2 se 


6. Identity operator 
	is , is not
eg:
    	x= 10 
	print( x is 5)   # flase
	print( x is 10)  #true

	y=10 
	print( y is not 5)  #true
	print( y is not 10) #flase


7. Membership operator 
	in, not in 
eg:
	name ="Ganesh"
	print( 'a' in name) #output True 
	print( 'g' in name) #output False
	print( 'e' not in name) #output False 
	print( 'g' not in name) # output True
